# Enhanced Calendar-Based Date Planning System

## Overview

The PlanGoReminisce application now features a comprehensive calendar-based date planning system that transforms trip date coordination from a simple list into a visual, interactive experience.

## Key Features

### 1. Visual Calendar Interface
- **FullCalendar.js Integration**: Rich, interactive calendar with month and week views
- **Event Visualization**: Date proposals and availability periods displayed as colored events
- **Click Interactions**: Click events to vote, click empty dates to propose new dates

### 2. Date Proposal System
- **Enhanced Model**: `DateProposal` now includes description and notes fields
- **Visual Display**: Proposals shown as green events on the calendar
- **Quick Creation**: Click and drag on calendar to propose date ranges
- **Detailed Information**: Add descriptions explaining why certain dates work well

### 3. Voting System
- **Interactive Voting**: Click on proposal events to vote Yes/No/Maybe
- **Real-time Updates**: Vote counts update immediately on the calendar
- **Visual Indicators**: User's vote shown on calendar events
- **Vote Summary**: Clear display of total votes for each option

### 4. User Availability System
- **Availability Types**: 
  - üö´ **Unavailable**: Cannot participate during these dates
  - üìÖ **Busy**: Difficult but possible
  - ‚≠ê **Preferred**: Ideal dates for the user
- **Visual Coding**: Different colors for each availability type
- **Personal Management**: Each user manages their own availability
- **Conflict Detection**: System can identify conflicts between proposals and availability

## Technical Architecture

### Models
- **`DateProposal`**: Enhanced with voting relationships and discussion fields
- **`DateProposalVote`**: Tracks user votes (yes/no/maybe) with validation
- **`UserAvailability`**: Manages user availability periods with types and descriptions

### Controllers
- **`DateProposalsController`**: Handles CRUD for proposals with new description field
- **`DateProposalVotesController`**: Manages voting via AJAX requests
- **`UserAvailabilitiesController`**: Handles availability periods
- **`Api::TripsController`**: Provides calendar events in JSON format

### Frontend
- **Calendar Stimulus Controller**: Manages FullCalendar instance and interactions
- **Modal System**: Beautiful modals for proposals, voting, and availability
- **Real-time Updates**: Calendar refreshes after votes and availability changes
- **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices

## Usage Workflow

### For Trip Organizers
1. Navigate to trip planning page
2. Click "Date Voting" to access calendar
3. Click "Propose New Dates" or click-drag on calendar
4. Add description explaining the proposal
5. View all proposals and votes on visual calendar
6. Make final date decision based on group feedback

### For Trip Participants
1. Access trip calendar from invitation
2. Add personal availability periods (work conflicts, preferences)
3. View all proposed dates on calendar
4. Click proposal events to vote
5. See real-time vote updates from other participants

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Calendar events loaded via API for better performance
- AJAX interactions prevent page reloads
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting ES6+ features
- FullCalendar.js handles cross-browser compatibility
- Graceful degradation for older browsers

### Accessibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible
- High contrast mode support
- Mobile touch optimization

## Deployment

The calendar system is fully integrated into the existing Rails application and requires no additional infrastructure. All dependencies are loaded via CDN for optimal performance.

### Dependencies Added
- FullCalendar.js (via importmap)
- Custom calendar.css styles
- Enhanced Stimulus controllers

### Database Migrations
All required migrations have been applied:
- `CreateDateProposalVotes`
- `CreateUserAvailabilities` 
- `AddDiscussionFieldsToDateProposals`

The system is ready for production use and scales with the existing Rails 8 architecture.
